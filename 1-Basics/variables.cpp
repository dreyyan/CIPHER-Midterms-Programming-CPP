ðŸ“¦ Variables in C++
==============================

A variable is like a "container" that stores data in your program.

Key points:
- Every variable has a **name** (identifier).
- Every variable has a **type** (e.g., int, char, string).
- A variable stores a **value** (which can change later).

ðŸ’¡ Why use variables?
- To store user input
- To perform calculations
- To reuse values without rewriting them

Example:
int age = 18;               // stores a whole number
char grade = 'A';           // stores a single character
std::string name = "Alice"; // stores text
