# 📘 C++ Midterms Programming - 1st Semester  

## 📌 Overview  
A collection of **C++ topic materials and practice problems** designed to reinforce concepts  
ranging from **basic syntax to data structures**.  
This repository was prepared by the **Research and Development Committee of CIPHER**  
to serve as a resource for **midterm preparation**.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Reinforce understanding of **C++ fundamentals and syntax**  
- Provide **progressive practice problems** to build problem-solving skills  
- Support WVSU-CICT 1st year students in preparing for **midterms and beyond**  

---

## 📚 Topics Covered  
- **Basic Syntax & Fundamentals** → Variables, operators, conditionals, loops  
- **Data Structures** → Strings only
- **Applied Practice** → Midterm-focused problems and challenges  

---

## 📋 Details  
- **Prepared by:** CIPHER · Research & Development Committee  
- **Purpose:** Midterms preparation & practice reinforcement  
- **Focus Language:** C++
